        <p>There are two common patterns to design concurrency programs, Thread or Event-driven. They can both handle large concurrency requests but have different tradeoffs. Using thread means you have to consider synchronization, resource utilization, etc. Using event-driven means you can&rsquo;t utilize multiple core CPU.</p>
<p>The most frequent operations that concurrency programming handles is I/O. A program that handles large concurrency must be an I/O intensive program instead of a CPU intensive program. And I/O has two modes: Blocking and Nonblocking.</p>
<p>As a programming language designed for concurrency, <strong>does Go use blocking or nonblocking I/O?</strong></p>
<p>To understand this question, we have to first understand the meaning of blocking and nonblocking. an I/O operation depends on external status(like network), when calling an I/O in blocking mode, it can blocks the program forever, while for nonblocking, it will return an error code to indicate the operation can&rsquo;t be complete now. The advantage of nonblocking is that it can be used together with multiplexing functions(epoll, kqueue), to achieve high concurrency effect.</p>
<p>All functions provided by Go is blocking, but this blocking is not blocking system thread but blocking the goroutine which runs the I/O operation. Underneath, Go uses nonblocking I/O that OS provides, this is a feature of the language to convert blocking to nonblocking, to make the concurrency code read and write straightforward.</p>
<p>The part that converts blocking I/O to nonblocking I/O is called <a href="https://morsmachine.dk/netpoller">netpoller</a>. whenever a goroutine read or write a file descriptor and receive an error code, it will call netpoller, tell it to notify the goroutine when it&rsquo;s ready to perform I/O again. netpoller was designed for network I/O, and later <a href="(https://github.com/golang/go/commit/c05b06a12d005f50e4776095a60d6bd9c2c91fac)">support for file I/O was also added</a>.</p>
<p>Does this mean all I/O in Go is nonblocking? the answer is: <strong>No, because the most common file I/O, disk I/O doesn&rsquo;t have the concept of nonblocking.</strong></p>
<p>This is a limitation of OS itself, in Unix, the kernel provides system call to provide services, and this includes disk or network I/O. System calls can be divided by functions, some are for I/O operations, some are for memory management, some are for process scheduling. But it can also be divided by &ldquo;slow&rdquo; system calls and others, the &ldquo;slow&rdquo; system calls are that may block the program forever.</p>
<p>In <em>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</em>, the author mentioned, these &ldquo;slow&rdquo; system calls include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reads that can block the caller forever if data isn&rsquo;t present with certain file types (pipes, terminal devices, and network devices)</li>
<li>Writes that can block the caller forever if the data can&rsquo;t be accepted immediately by these same file types (no room in the pipe, network flow control, etc.)</li>
<li>Opens that block until some condition occurs on certain file types (such as an open of a terminal device that waits until an attached modem answers the phone, or an open of a FIFO for writing-only when no other process has the FIFO open for reading)</li>
<li>Reads and writes of files that have mandatory record locking enabled</li>
<li>Certain ioctl operations</li>
<li>Some of the interprocess communication functions</li>
</ul>
<p>And the book also mentioned that disk I/O are not considered slow, even though the read or write of a disk file can block the caller temporarily.</p>
<p>When you add a normal file descriptor to <code>select</code>, it will always report it as readable and writable. and <code>epoll</code> will return an error, forbid you to add a normal file descriptor.</p>
<p>So, in Go, when doing disk I/O, it not only parks the goroutine, it will operate as a normal system call, park the system thread to wait for the call to complete. Of course, this is not seen by Go users. All I/O operations are blocking from the language perspective, that&rsquo;s why it is designed for concurrency, you don&rsquo;t need to care about thread creation or destroy, either care about callback of event loop. Through goroutine, one can write code that easier to understand and achieve a good concurrency effect.</p>
<p>Disk I/O doesn&rsquo;t support nonblocking, but it can be asynchronous through AIO or the new Linux kernel technique <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/810414/">io_uring</a>. Go community also started the discussion about how to <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31908">support new linux io_uring interface</a>. Thanks to the new kernel technology, we should be able to see better performance improvements on disk reads and writes in the near future.</p>
